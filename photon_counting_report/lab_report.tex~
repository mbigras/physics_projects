\begin{abstract}
We explored the statistics for photons arriving from a constant intensity and a randomly scattered light source. We measured the number of photons arriving per a unit time. By constructing probability distributions and calculating $\chi^{2}$ values we found the distribution for constant intensity light to agree with a Poisson distribution and the distribution for randomly scattered light to agree with a Bose-Einstein distribution.

\section{Introduction}
We used a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a photon counter to directly count the number of photons arriving per a unit time from two different light sources. By overlaying our experimental distribution over a theoretical distribution based on statistics we illustrated the probabilistic nature of the photodetection process itself \cite{koc}.



\section{Theory}
The probability of ejection of an electron from the PMT photocathode depends only on the intensity of the light \cite{manual}. We are interested in the probability of obtaining $n$ counts in some large time interval $T$, for a constant intensity light source and a randomly scattered light source. 

For a constant intensity light source and from statistics the probability of detecting $n$ photons in time $T$ is

\begin{equation}
P(n,T) = \frac{n_{\mathrm{av}}^{n}}{n!}e^{-n_{\mathrm{av}}}
\label{poisson}
\end{equation}
where $n_{\mathrm{av}}$ is the average number of photons counted in time $T$.

But this is the Poisson distribution. So we expect a constant intensity light source to cause electrons to be ejected from the cathod of the PMT with a Poisson distribution.

What if the intensity of light varies in space randomly? This is the case for randomly scattered light. If on can determine the intensity of the light at any spatial location, which is possible, and perform a weighted average then the probability of detecting $n$ photons in time $T$ is

\begin{equation}
P(n,T) = \frac{n_{\mathrm{av}}^{n}}{(n_{\mathrm{av}}+1)^{n+1}}
\label{bose}
\end{equation}

But this is the Bose-Einstein distribution. So we expect a randomly scattered light source to cause electrons to be ejected from the cathod of the PMT with a Bose-Einstein distribution.

\section{Apparatus}
Our apparatus is shown in Figure \ref{apparatus}. We used photons produced by an HeNe laser, which emits around $10^{18}$ photons per a second. We are interested in counting a few thousand photons per a second, so we are required to reduce the intensity of the laser. We attenuate the laser in three ways, first we polarize the laser beam then we spread it out with a short focal length lens and finally we pass the light through two pinholes (<100 $\mu$m diameter). Any surviving photons are detected by the the PMT and finally counted by the photon counter. The photon counter detects pulses above a discriminator level and counts the number of pulses per unit time.

\end{figure}

It's important to count pulses coming from photons and not the noise form the PMT. We measured how the count rate varies with increasing discriminator level. Initially there is a fast change as the noise gets filtered out, shown in Figure \ref{dlevel}, then the curve flattens out and again begins to dip down as be begin also filtering out the pulses from the photons. Because we're interested in detecting photons away from the noise we chose our discriminator level to be in the flat region.
